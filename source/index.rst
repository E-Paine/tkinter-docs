Welcome to tkinter-docs!
************************

This is designed as a reference for the regular Tk widgets. It is mostly just
a 'translation' of the
`Tk 8.6 Man pages <https://www.tcl.tk/man/tcl8.6/TkCmd/contents.htm>`_ into
what is hopefully a more understandable and newcomer-friendly form.

It is currently a work-in-progress (with lots of 'TODO's!).

.. note::
    Not all options detailed here will be available on all Tk versions.

.. note::
    Internal tkinter methods are not documented here as they are subject to
    change without notice.

.. note::
    To maintain consistency with Python's built-in ``help`` function, this
    guide tries to maintain the tkinter method signatures. As-such, they will
    not always match those found on the Tk man page.

.. note::
    This reference makes no claim about how up-to-date or accurate the content
    is. It was up-to-date at the time of writing and I kindly ask any issues
    are reported on the
    `Github page <https://github.com/E-Paine/tkinter-docs>`_ (trivial patches
    are also welcome!).

    This work is licensed under CC0, but as it is heavy derived from the Tk
    man pages, any derivatives of this work must also include the Tk
    attribution.
