Welcome to tkinter-docs!
************************

This is designed as a reference for the regular Tk widgets. It is mostly just a
'translation' of the
`Tk 8.6 Man pages <https://www.tcl.tk/man/tcl8.6/TkCmd/contents.htm>`_ into
what is hopefully a more understandable and newcomer-friendly form.

It is currently a work-in-progress (with lots of 'TODO's!).

.. note::
    Not all options detailed here will be available on all Tk versions.

.. note::
    Internal tkinter methods are not documented here as they are subject to
    change without notice.

.. note::
    This reference makes no claim about how up-to-date or accurate the content
    is. It was up-to-date at the time of writing and I kindly ask any issues
    are reported on the
    `Github page <https://github.com/E-Paine/tkinter-docs>`_.
